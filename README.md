## üìù What is the Budget Management Application?
> The following project is a Budget Management Application. This application will allow users to create a monthly budget, manage their expenses, and track their progress.
> Besides these three key features, the application also offers users money saving challenges/games and a feature to remove unwanted subscriptions to save further money. 

## üë©‚Äçüè´ Application Walk Through
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Budget Management Application Model ###
> Before we began our project, we did some research and designed an application model of how we would want our application to look like once done. As you can see from the screen capture of the model provided below, we decide to make an application with the following 8 distinct sections: login/registration, transactions/records, subscriptions, analysis, budget plan, categories, categories, and challenges/games.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Budget Management Application Database ###
> For our project, we used MySQL to store user records. This is how the database looked like at the end.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Budget Management File Structure ###
> We used InteliJ IDEA to make our project but any other IDE would work fine too.
> We organized our project into folders so that it would be easier to find each others work. The folder structure is: auth (for loginapp authorization), connection (to connect to our database), controller (for menu at the bottom of page to navigate user through program), components (gui components for loginapp), and lastly pages (where most of the pages we designed for application are located).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ S.O.M.E Budget Management Application Demo ###

##Section #1 - Login/Registration Page ##
>When you first launch the application, you will be prompted to login. If you have a login, great: you can login right away! However, if you're a new user, you can click on the "Create an Account" button which will redirect you to the registration page. Here you will be asked to fill out your full name, username, email, and passcode. If you enter one of the field (for example email field) incorrectly, the page will error asking you to enter correct email address (especially when missing @ sign). Once you create an account and/or if you already have an account you can login! Please note, if you enter your password or username incorrectly the program will error until you input correct credentials. Another feature we added was the eye icon on the side of the password which would allow the user to verify the password they entered before attempting to login.
