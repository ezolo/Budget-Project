>4.) Working with Eclipse and GitHub Desktop <br>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.1) Make Sure to grab JDBC Connector Jar for MySQL found here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/<br>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  4.1a.) Click "Platform Independent" and download zip. To add jar to project, follow steps from class JDBC slides<br>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.2.) When you make some changes, make sure are on your branch that you created (should be title of project). If not switch to your branch. Do not push changes to "Main", we will be doing that together to avoid merge conflict. <br>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.3.) Once you make some changes in your branch, you will commit changes<br>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.3a.) In Eclipse, right-click the project (where you made changes) and select "Team" > "Commit".<br>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.3b.) Add a commit message (what changes you made) and click "Commit".<br>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.4.) Once you commit changes to your branch, you will need to push your changes to repo.<br>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.4a.) In GitHub Desktop, click "Push" to push the changes to the remote repository.<br>
>>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.5.) Before making any new changes, it's recommended for you to Pull new changes from repo<br>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.5a.) In GitHub Desktop, click "Fetch" to get the latest changes from the remote repository.<br>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.5b.) Click "Pull" to merge the changes into your local repository<br>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.5c.) After pulling changes from GitHub Desktop, refresh your Eclipse project to see the updates.¬†<br>
>5.) Setting up MySQL on your end<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1) Download MySQL Workbench from: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2) When download finished, enter MySQL Workbench and if there is no connections available, create new "local host" connection. There are many tutorials online how to do this, you can use this youtube video as example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQ2XV2n-pk<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3.) Once new connection created, open new query tabe: File --> New Query Tab and run the DDL and DML files. DDL creates schema and tables, DML creates mock data<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4.) Once you run queries, refresh budget_management database: right click on budget_management schema and select "refresh all". <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5) Confirm that 6 tables have been created<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.6) Confirm that there is mock data in users table by running: select * from users; There should be 3 records<br>

> **Side Notes**<br>
> Remember to Pull new changes before making any new changes of your own.
> We will work together to merge changes to main branch and solve any merge conflicts together.
